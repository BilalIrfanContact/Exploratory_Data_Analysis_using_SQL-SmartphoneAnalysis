# Smartphone Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

**Dataset Used:** [Smartphone Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jenilhareshbhaighori/smartphone-data-analysis-using)

**Project Objectives and Scope:**  
The primary objective of this project was to perform comprehensive data analysis on a smartphone dataset to derive valuable insights into various aspects such as ratings, prices, features, and performance metrics across different brands. The scope included exploring advanced SQL techniques, such as subqueries, temporary tables, common table expressions (CTEs), and stored procedures, to perform intricate data analysis and generate meaningful reports.

## Project Implementation

### Data Loading and Preparation:
- Importing and understanding the dataset structure.
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data as necessary.

### Query Development:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Initially, simple SQL queries were crafted to understand the dataset's structure and content. This included selecting all records and identifying key columns like brand, model, price, rating, and features.
- **Subqueries:** Utilized subqueries to perform filtering and aggregation tasks, such as identifying the highest-rated smartphones within each brand.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Implemented CTEs to create modular and readable queries, particularly for calculating average ratings within different price ranges.
- **Stored Procedures:** Developed stored procedures to encapsulate complex queries, allowing for parameterized data retrieval based on brand, price range, and rating criteria.

### Key Features and Functionalities Developed:
- Identification of top-rated smartphones across different brands.
- Analysis of 5G support percentages by brand.
- Calculation of average prices across brands.
- Filtering smartphones below the average price.
- Development of stored procedures for brand-specific and multi-parameter filtering.
- Calculation of price-to-performance ratios to determine value for money.
- Analysis of feature availability percentages (NFC, IR blaster, extended memory) by brand.
- Categorization of smartphones into price ranges and calculation of average ratings within each range using CTEs.

## Achievements and Outcomes

### Achievements:
- Successfully implemented advanced SQL techniques to perform intricate data analysis.
- Developed a versatile stored procedure to filter smartphones based on multiple parameters.
- Derived valuable insights into the price-to-performance ratio and feature availability across brands.
- Categorized smartphones into price ranges and analyzed their average ratings.

### Outcomes:
- Identified the highest-rated smartphones across various brands.
- Determined that certain brands offer better value for money based on the price-to-performance ratio.
- Revealed significant differences in 5G support, NFC, IR blaster, and extended memory availability across brands.

## Learning and Skills Acquired

### New Skills and Knowledge Gained:
- Mastery of advanced SQL techniques, including subqueries, CTEs, and stored procedures.
- Enhanced understanding of data analysis and reporting.
- Refined ability to structure and organize complex SQL queries.
- Better understanding of database management and data preprocessing.

## Conclusion
The project successfully achieved its objectives of performing comprehensive data analysis on a smartphone dataset using advanced SQL techniques. Significant insights were derived, including top-rated smartphones, value-for-money analysis, and feature availability across brands. The project also facilitated the development of key SQL skills and laid the groundwork for future enhancements and more sophisticated analysis. Overall, the project demonstrated the power and versatility of SQL in data analysis and reporting, making a significant impact on understanding the smartphone market. This project is a notable addition to my portfolio, showcasing my ability to master advanced SQL queries and apply them to real-world data analysis scenarios.
